# Scalable-Federated-Clustering-and-Pattern-Recognition-for-Multi-Modal-Traffic-Data-in-Smart-Cities

Smart cities generate voluminous multi-modal traffic data emanating from cameras, LiDAR, radar, and IoT devices. Most of the existing centralized analytics solutions exhibit critical challenges in terms of privacy, bandwidth, and scalability. This work proposes a Scalable Federated Clustering Framework that conducts local unsupervised clustering at distributed edge nodes and transmits only cluster parameters (centroids) to a central server for global traffic pattern recognition. Based on KITTI raw data, including LiDAR, camera, and OXTS, we extract compact features, conduct local K-Means clustering, and aggre- gate clusters using weighted federated aggregation. The results of our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in recognizing dense/medium/sparse traffic density, retaining compact clusters globally, reducing communication burdens substantially, and maintaining the privacy of raw data.
